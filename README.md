### 💡💡💡💡 Background
This is my fourth independent project since I began learning how to program in early 2018.

After finishing [my last project](https://github.com/DevDW/lexical-amplifier), I had a few things on my mind about future project ideas, existing interests that I wanted to incorporate into those projects, and cutting-edge areas I'd like to learn more about. I decided to bring my existing interest in cryptocurrencies together with my desire to learn more about artificial intelligence (AI). 

The project name, DigiCurr Sentiment, describes what the project is about. "DigiCurr" is a portmanteau of "digital" and "currency," since cryptocurrencies are a major type of digital currency, and "Sentiment" points to what the project is analyzing and measuring.
